Feature: BBC Sport App onboarding screens
    I want to verify the BBC Sport App onboarding screens
    function as intended after login.

    Scenario: Verify onboarding screen allows choosing from popular sports
        Given I log in to the BBC Sport App
        Then I am on the onboarding screen, containing the most popular sports
